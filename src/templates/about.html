    <div class="about-content">
        I grew up in Toronto, Ontario where I completed elementary and high school. Growing up, I was an avid hockey fan. I particularly enjoy playing outdoor games in the winter.

        I also love to travel. I've been to a few different continents and met some really cool people along the way. My travels have brought me on trips ranging from African safari to internships in San Francisco.<span class="show-places-text"> Click show places to see all the places I have traveled.</span>

        I also enjoy listening to music. Whenever I am at my computer and usually when I'm on the go, I always have tunes playing. Below are some of my favourite songs.
